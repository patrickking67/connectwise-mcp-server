# ConnectWise Manage MCP Server

`connectwise-manage-mcp` — run **ConnectWise PSA (Manage)** from Claude, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, or any other MCP client, locally or as a **remote MCP connector**. ConnectWise **Automate** (RMM) and **Control** (ScreenConnect, beta) register themselves alongside it when you configure them.

- **Every tool is `cw_*`** on the wire and Title Case in the UI: `cw_list_boards` shows as **List Boards**.
- **Three kinds of tool, declared, not implied:** read-only, write, and interactive. Hosts that gate on MCP annotations (Claude, Microsoft 365 Copilot, ChatGPT) get an honest answer for every single tool.
- **One code path, every surface:** local stdio, remote Streamable HTTP, and an MCPB bundle serve the same catalog.

> **This connector writes.** It creates and updates tickets, adds notes, and creates time and expense entries, and it carries guarded raw-request tools for all three products. The remote entry **refuses to start** unless `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` or the Entra pair is configured — an open endpoint is not a degraded deployment of it. `MCP_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=true` overrides the guard for a local, non-routable test and says so loudly on every start.

**Guides:** [docs/TOOLS.md](docs/TOOLS.md) — the full tool catalog · [docs/deploying-azure.md](docs/deploying-azure.md) — the Azure runbook (Bicep, Key Vault, OIDC deploys) · [docs/GO-LIVE.md](docs/GO-LIVE.md) — remaining steps to flip it on · [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) — zero-to-working walkthrough · [docs/ENTRA_SETUP.md](docs/ENTRA_SETUP.md) — per-user Microsoft Entra sign-in instead of the shared token.

## How tools are named and classified

| | Convention | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wire name | `cw_` + snake_case (`cw_search_tickets`, `cw_automate_get_computer`) | MCP identifies a tool by `name`; one prefix keeps ConnectWise tools together when a client aggregates several servers |
| Display name | Title Case, derived from the name (**Search Tickets**) | Sent as both `title` and `annotations.title`, because clients read one or the other |
| Kind | `read` · `write` · `interactive` | Read-only tools carry `readOnlyHint`; write tools declare `destructiveHint`/`idempotentHint`; interactive tools additionally declare an MCP Apps `ui://` resource |

No tool is left unannotated. Microsoft 365 Copilot treats an unannotated tool as destructive and prompts for it; Claude only parallelizes calls it has been told are read-only. Both facts are load-bearing here, so `src/tools/spec.ts` derives the annotations from a single declared kind and `registerSpecTool` is the only way a tool gets registered.

The raw write escape hatches (`cw_api_write`, `cw_automate_api_write`) also set `_meta["anthropic/requiresUserInteraction"]`, which makes Claude Code prompt a person on **every** call with no "don't ask again" — and they still require `confirm: true` on the calls that cannot be undone. Control is the one surface that does not split by HTTP verb: its `.ashx` services answer reads over POST, so `cw_control_api_request` keeps both methods, stays classified as a write, and refuses POST without `confirm: true`.

## Client support

| Client | Transport | What it does with the annotations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | stdio or Streamable HTTP | Runs read-only tools in parallel, prompts on writes, always prompts on the `*_api_write` tools ([docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp)) |
| **Claude Desktop / claude.ai** | MCPB bundle or custom connector URL | Same annotations; renders the interactive ticket card where MCP Apps is enabled |
| **ChatGPT / OpenAI Responses API** | Streamable HTTP | Reads `readOnlyHint` for approval filtering and `_meta["openai/outputTemplate"]` for the card ([Apps SDK](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/)) |
| **Microsoft 365 Copilot / Copilot Studio** | Streamable HTTP | Confirms any tool where `readOnlyHint` is false or `destructiveHint` is true, labelling the prompt with `annotations.title` ([Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/extensibility/plugin-confirmation-prompts)) |
| **VS Code / Visual Studio Copilot** | stdio or HTTP | Per-tool approval, remembered per session or solution ([Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/mcp-servers)) |
| **MCP Inspector, Cursor, others** | either | Plain MCP: names, titles, annotations, JSON results |

## Local and remote

| | **Local** | **Remote** |
|---|---|---|
| Transport | stdio | Streamable HTTP (stateless) |
| Entry point | `dist/stdio.js` | `dist/index.js` |
| Runs | On your machine, beside the client | Azure Container Apps |
| Holds the ConnectWise credentials | Your machine | Key Vault |
| Authenticates callers | The OS user account | Shared token or Microsoft Entra ID |
| Installed as | An MCPB bundle (`npm run mcpb:pack`) | A URL in your client |
| Reaches | Claude Code, Desktop, on-device Cowork | …and remote Cowork, claude.ai, ChatGPT, Microsoft Foundry |

Stateless HTTP means any number of replicas can serve traffic. Azure Container Apps is the deploy target described in [docs/deploying-azure.md](docs/deploying-azure.md), and the image is portable to any container host.

## Prerequisites

1. **PSA API Member keys** (recommended over personal keys): PSA → System → Members → API Members → create member with an appropriate security role → API Keys tab → generate public/private key pair.
2. **Developer clientId**: register at <https://developer.connectwise.com/ClientID>. Required header on every PSA call. Treat it like a secret.
3. Your PSA site host. Cloud regions must use the `api-` prefix (`api-na.myconnectwise.net`, `api-eu...`, `api-au...`); the server auto-corrects the bare host. On-premise: your own hostname (HTTPS required).

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CW_PSA_SITE` | yes | e.g. `api-na.myconnectwise.net` |
| `CW_PSA_COMPANY_ID` | yes | your PSA login company id |
| `CW_PSA_PUBLIC_KEY` / `CW_PSA_PRIVATE_KEY` | yes | API member keys |
| `CW_PSA_CLIENT_ID` | yes | developer clientId GUID |
| `CW_PSA_VERSION` | no | pin API model version, e.g. `2026.4` |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | strongly recommended | protects the `/mcp` endpoint; `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `CW_AUTOMATE_URL` / `CW_AUTOMATE_USERNAME` / `CW_AUTOMATE_PASSWORD` / `CW_AUTOMATE_CLIENT_ID` | no | set all four to enable Automate tools |
| `CW_SCREENCONNECT_URL` / `CW_SCREENCONNECT_USERNAME` / `CW_SCREENCONNECT_PASSWORD` | no | set all three to enable the beta Control tools |
| `PORT` | no | default 8080 |

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:8080/mcp
npm test             # unit + integration tests
npm run tools:check  # generated tool docs still match the code
```

Quick check: `curl localhost:8080/healthz`, then point the MCP inspector at it:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
# Streamable HTTP -> http://localhost:8080/mcp  (Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>)
```

## Install locally (MCPB bundle)

```bash
npm ci
npm run mcpb:pack     # produces connectwise-manage-mcp.mcpb
```

Install it through **Settings → Extensions → Advanced settings** in Claude for macOS or Windows. The installer prompts for the PSA credentials, and for the Automate ones if you want that module.

For Claude Code, point at the stdio entry directly:

```bash
claude mcp add connectwise -- node /absolute/path/to/connectwise-mcp-server/dist/stdio.js
```

## Deploy to Azure Container Apps

The quick path below creates an app from source and is fine for a first look. For a repeatable deployment — Bicep, Key Vault-backed secrets, a managed identity, and an OIDC-federated deploy workflow — use [`infra/main.bicep`](infra/main.bicep) and follow [docs/deploying-azure.md](docs/deploying-azure.md).

```bash
RG=rg-connectwise-mcp
APP=connectwise-mcp
LOC=eastus
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

az group create -n $RG -l $LOC

# Build from source (ACR task) and create the app + environment in one shot
az containerapp up -n $APP -g $RG -l $LOC --ingress external --target-port 8080 --source .

# Secrets + env, scale to zero when idle
az containerapp secret set -n $APP -g $RG --secrets \
  cw-psa-company-id='YOUR_COMPANY_ID' \
  cw-psa-public-key='YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY' \
  cw-psa-private-key='YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY' \
  cw-psa-client-id='YOUR_CLIENT_GUID' \
  mcp-auth-token="$TOKEN"

az containerapp update -n $APP -g $RG \
  --min-replicas 0 --max-replicas 3 \
  --set-env-vars \
    CW_PSA_SITE=api-na.myconnectwise.net \
    CW_PSA_COMPANY_ID=secretref:cw-psa-company-id \
    CW_PSA_PUBLIC_KEY=secretref:cw-psa-public-key \
    CW_PSA_PRIVATE_KEY=secretref:cw-psa-private-key \
    CW_PSA_CLIENT_ID=secretref:cw-psa-client-id \
    MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=secretref:mcp-auth-token

az containerapp show -n $APP -g $RG --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn -o tsv
echo "MCP URL: https://<fqdn>/mcp   token: $TOKEN"
```

Any other container host (Railway, Fly.io, Cloud Run, a VPS) works the same way: build the Dockerfile, set the env vars, expose port 8080.

## Connect AI clients

| Client | How |
| --- | --- |
| **claude.ai custom connector** | Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector → URL `https://<host>/mcp/<MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>` (path token, since custom connectors can't send headers) |
| **Claude Code** | `claude mcp add --transport http connectwise https://<host>/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>"` |
| **Claude Desktop / others** | Streamable HTTP URL + `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header |
| **Local stdio** | `npm run build` then `claude mcp add connectwise -e CW_PSA_SITE=... -e CW_PSA_COMPANY_ID=... -e CW_PSA_PUBLIC_KEY=... -e CW_PSA_PRIVATE_KEY=... -e CW_PSA_CLIENT_ID=... -- node <repo>/dist/stdio.js` |

## Security notes

- ConnectWise credentials live **server-side only**; MCP clients never see them. Scope the API member's security role to what you actually want AI to do (the PSA security role matrix applies to API calls).
- The endpoint token can be sent as a Bearer header or embedded in the URL path (capability URL) for clients that can't send headers. Rotate it by updating the secret.
- **Per-user auth:** set `AZURE_TENANT_ID` + `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and the server validates Microsoft Entra bearer JWTs (signature/issuer/audience/expiry) and serves RFC 9728 OAuth discovery metadata — see [docs/ENTRA_SETUP.md](docs/ENTRA_SETUP.md). Works alongside or instead of the shared token.
- Destructive guardrails, unchanged by the read/write split: `cw_api_write` refuses `DELETE` without `confirm: true`, `cw_automate_api_write` refuses every call without it, and `cw_control_api_request` refuses `POST` without it. The read escape hatches (`cw_api_request`, `cw_automate_api_request`) cannot issue anything but `GET`.
- Annotations are hints, not enforcement — the guardrails above are in the handlers, where they hold regardless of what a client does with the metadata.

## Claude plugin + marketplace

This repo also ships a **Claude Code plugin** that wraps the hosted server with 13 auto-activating MSP workflow skills (ticket triage, ticket creation, time, expenses, client overview, asset management, projects, agreements & billing, sales pipeline, procurement, dispatch, RMM, remote support) and `/cw-status` + `/cw-triage` commands. The repo root is a marketplace, so installing is two lines:

```
/plugin marketplace add patrickking67/connectwise-mcp-server
/plugin install connectwise@connectwise-manage-mcp
```

Then set `CONNECTWISE_MCP_URL` (your `/mcp` endpoint) and `CONNECTWISE_MCP_TOKEN`. Details in [plugins/connectwise/README.md](plugins/connectwise/README.md).

## Roadmap

- **Port the rest of the fleet's repository baseline.** The other connectors carry `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, a governance policy, and a `check-repo-contract.mjs` invariant checker wired into CI. This repository has CI, a changelog, generated tool docs and `CLAUDE.md`, but not the rest.
- **More interactive surfaces.** The ticket card is the first; company overview and time-entry confirmation are the obvious next two.
- **Harden the Control (ScreenConnect) module** — it ships as beta (forms-auth, version-dependent); validate against live instances and add session actions.
- Callback (webhook) receiver for PSA ticket events.
