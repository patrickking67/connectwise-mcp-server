# ConnectWise Asset Management

Answer "what do we manage for this client" and find specific devices fast.

## Tools

- `psa_search_configurations` — managed devices/assets (servers, workstations, network gear, etc.)
- `psa_api_request` — configuration types (`/company/configurations/types`) and anything else under `/company/configurations/*`

## Workflow

1. **Search configurations.** `psa_search_configurations`:
   - A client's active assets: `company/identifier="acme" and activeFlag=true`
   - By type: `type/name="Managed Workstation"` or `type/name="Server"`
   - By identity: `serialNumber="ABC123"`, `tagNumber="..."`, or `name contains "SRV"`
   - By address: `ipAddress="10.0.0.5"`
2. **Report.** Group by type for a footprint view; per asset surface name, type, status, serial, IP, OS, last login, and active flag. Note inactive/retired separately.
3. **Lifecycle** when asked: installation date and warranty/expiration live on the config — pull `fields: "all"` or query specific fields for warranty dates.

## Tips

- "What do we manage for them" → active configs grouped by type, with counts.
- Custom asset attributes: search with `customFieldConditions` (e.g. `caption="Warranty" AND value!=null`).
- Tie an asset to its tickets via the company + config reference when troubleshooting.

## Guardrails

Read-first. Confirm before creating/updating or retiring configurations.
