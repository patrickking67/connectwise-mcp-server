# ConnectWise Project Management

Give a project manager a clear read on where projects stand: status, work remaining, and budget health.

## Tools

- `psa_search_projects` — projects by status, manager, company, dates
- `psa_search_project_tickets` — work items within projects (phases, owners, status)
- `psa_search_time_entries` — actuals logged against project work
- `psa_api_request` — phases (`/project/projects/{id}/phases`), team members, and anything else under `/project/*`

## Workflow

1. **Find the project.** `psa_search_projects`:
   - Active: `closedFlag=false` (optionally `status/name="Open"`)
   - A client's: `company/identifier="acme" and closedFlag=false`
   - A PM's book: `manager/identifier="pking" and closedFlag=false`
2. **Status read.** For each project surface: status, % via budget vs. actual hours (`actualHours` vs `budgetHours`), estimated end, and open ticket count. Flag over-budget (`actualHours > budgetHours`) and past-due (`estimatedEnd < today`).
3. **Drill into work.** `psa_search_project_tickets` with `project/id=<id> and closedFlag=false`, grouped by phase. Show owners and what's in flight vs. not started.
4. **Phases / team** when asked: `psa_api_request GET /project/projects/{id}/phases` and `/project/projects/{id}/teamMembers`.

## Tips

- Budget health = `actualHours` vs `budgetHours`; call out projects past ~80% with open work.
- For "what's due this week," filter project tickets by `requiredDate` within the window.
- Compact fields suffice for status; pull detail per ticket only when needed.

## Guardrails

Read-first. Confirm before changing project/ticket status or reassigning, and never close project items unless explicitly asked.
